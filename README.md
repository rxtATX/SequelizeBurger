# [SequelizeBurger](https://evening-retreat-19942.herokuapp.com/)

This application was assigned in order to practice the ORM Sequelize, and uses a MERN stack. 

A user can "cook" a burger, "eat" said burger, and then "throw away the wrapper". 
  These methods practice:
    * Create
    * Put
    * Delete

# Installation

Pull down codes.
Run NPM install.
MySQL workbench is required to run in a local environment.
Populate the database from within the browser.
